# Bnong's Spelling Bee Bot

An intelligent Roblox Spelling Bee assistant that listens to the game in real-time, recognises the target word the instant the pronouncer says it, and types the answer with convincing human-like behaviour — burst typing, natural hesitations, typos, and backspace corrections.

## Features

### Autoplay (default — recommended)

- **Continuous listening** — bot captures all desktop audio non-stop via audio loopback and detects speech automatically using voice activity detection (VAD)
- **Instant typing** — by the time the pronouncer finishes saying the word, Bnong's Spelling Bee Bot has already matched it; one Right Shift press fires the answer immediately
- **Smart Word Recognition** — you don't even have to wait for the pronouncer to finish! Press Right Shift mid-pronunciation and the bot instantly grabs whatever partial audio has been captured, transcribes it, and matches the closest word from the word bank. Just like a pro player who recognises the word halfway through hearing it
- **Word expiry** — detected words expire after 8 seconds so stale transcriptions never auto-fire
- **Turn timeout** — if no word is heard within 10 seconds of your turn signal, the bot gives up gracefully (and optionally rage-reacts)

### Manual Mode (alternative)

- **Toggle recording** — press Right Shift to start capturing, press again to stop
- **Smart Word Recognition** — stop the recording before the word is even fully pronounced and the bot still finds the best match from the word bank using prefix matching, fuzzy scoring, and prefix proximity analysis
- **Runs on demand** — only listens when you tell it to

### AI Word Matching

- **Multi-candidate scoring** — uses every one of Google's transcription alternatives, not just the top result
- **Preamble detection** — automatically strips announcer phrases ("the next word is", "please spell", etc.) before matching
- **Multi-strategy extraction** — tries last word, joined words, last 2/3/5 combined, and each individual word; handles split transcriptions like "phantom goria" → "phantasmagoria"
- **Prefix matching** — if the transcription is the start of a word bank entry (e.g. "phan" → "phantasmagoria"), it scores as a strong match — this is what powers Smart Word Recognition for partial pronunciations
- **Prefix proximity bonus** — even if the transcription isn't an exact prefix, words that share a long common starting sequence get a score boost
- **Dual fuzzy matching** — scores with both `SequenceMatcher` and character trigram Jaccard similarity
- **Audio duration bias** — uses recording length to estimate expected word length and penalise suspiciously short matches
- **1,006-word bank** — covers Advanced, Expert, Genius, Master, and more
- **Level filter** — lock matching to a specific game level so short easy words can't steal matches from long ones

### Humanizer

- **7 skill presets** — Beginner through Master; each changes speed, burst behaviour, pause timing, and typo frequency
- **Burst typing** — random fast segments that look like confident key runs
- **Speed drift** — typing speed naturally accelerates and decelerates within a word
- **Thinking hesitations** — word complexity score drives mid-word pauses (harder words get more pauses at the trickiest positions)
- **Typo & backspace** — types 1–3 wrong QWERTY-neighbour keys, pauses, then either quick-fixes or rewrites from the beginning like a real person
- **Modifier release** — releases Shift/Ctrl/Alt/Enter before typing to prevent phantom key presses

### Bonus Modes

- **Rage Mode** — on transcription failure: keyboard smash → panic delete → random funny fail message typed into chat
- **Flex Mode** — before the real answer: 70% chance keyboard spam, 30% chance a meme phrase ("LETTHEMCOOKKK", "WEARESOOOBACKKK", etc.), then deletes it and types the real word

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** installed and added to PATH
- **Windows or macOS**
- **Audio loopback device** — Stereo Mix on Windows, or BlackHole on macOS (see setup below)
- **Internet connection** (Google Speech API requires network access)
- **macOS only:** Accessibility permission for your terminal app (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility)

---

## Step 1 — Set Up Audio Loopback

The bot needs to hear what your speakers are playing. This requires a loopback/virtual audio device.

### Windows

1. Right-click the **speaker icon** in the system tray → **Sounds**.
2. Go to the **Recording** tab.
3. Right-click in the empty area → check **Show Disabled Devices**.
4. Right-click **Stereo Mix** → **Enable**.

> If Stereo Mix doesn't appear, update your Realtek/audio drivers or check your sound card documentation.

### macOS

1. Install **BlackHole** (free, open-source virtual audio driver):
   ```
   brew install blackhole-2ch
   ```
   Or download from [github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole).

2. Open **Audio MIDI Setup** (search in Spotlight).

3. Click the + button at the bottom left → **Create Multi-Output Device**.

4. In the new Multi-Output Device, tick **both**:
   - Your real speakers/headphones (e.g. "MacBook Pro Speakers")
   - **BlackHole 2ch**

5. Right-click the Multi-Output Device → **Use This Device For Sound Output**.

> This routes all system audio to both your speakers (so you can still hear) AND BlackHole (so the bot can listen).

> **Tip:** If BlackHole appears as **"Offline Device"** instead of "BlackHole 2ch", the driver hasn't fully activated yet. Simply **restart your Mac** then it will show the correct name after rebooting.

> **Tip:** You may see advice online to run `sudo launchctl kickstart -kp system/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod` to reload the audio daemon. On modern macOS with SIP enabled this will fail with "Operation not permitted", that's expected and harmless. A full restart is the reliable fix.

6. **Grant Accessibility permission** to your terminal app:
   - Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
   - Add and enable your terminal (Terminal.app, iTerm2, VS Code, etc.)

> This is required for the bot to simulate keystrokes via pynput.

---

## Step 2 — Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in this folder and run:

**Windows:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**macOS:**
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **macOS note:** Always use `python3 -m pip` rather than just `pip` on macOS. This ensures packages are installed into the same Python that runs the script. Using plain `pip` can install into a different Python version and cause `ModuleNotFoundError` when you run the bot.

This installs: `sounddevice`, `scipy`, `numpy`, `SpeechRecognition`, `keyboard`, `pynput`.

> **Note:** On macOS, the `keyboard` package is not used at runtime — the bot uses `pynput` for keyboard control instead. You can safely ignore any `keyboard` install warnings.

---

## Step 3 — Run the Bot

**Windows:**
```
python spelling_bee_bot.py
```

**macOS:**
```
python3 spelling_bee_bot.py
```

On launch the script lists all audio input devices and auto-selects the loopback device (Stereo Mix on Windows, BlackHole on macOS). If it can't find one you'll be prompted to enter the device index manually.

## Controls

### Autoplay Mode (default)

| Key             | Action                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Right Shift** | Signal "it's my turn" — bot types the word instantly if ready |
| **Esc**         | Quit                                                          |

**Workflow:**

1. Run the bot and focus the Roblox window.
2. Bnong's Spelling Bee Bot listens in the background the entire time.
3. When it's your turn in the game, press **Right Shift once**.
   - If the word was already heard → typed immediately.
   - If the pronunciation is still going → **Smart Word Recognition** kicks in: the bot grabs whatever partial audio exists right now, transcribes it, and matches the closest word from the bank. No need to wait for the pronouncer to finish.
   - If no audio has been detected yet → bot waits and fires the moment a word is detected (with timeout fallback).

### Manual Mode (`AUTOPLAY = False`)

| Key             | Action                                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Right Shift** | Press to START, press again to STOP recording |
| **Esc**         | Quit                                          |

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sounddevice'` | Run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` instead of plain `pip install`. |
| `[!] Could not transcribe`     | Make sure your audio loopback device is set up and game volume is audible.            |
| Wrong word matched             | Set `WORDBANK_LEVEL` to the game difficulty you're playing.                           |
| Word not in bank               | Add it to `wordbank.txt` under the correct section.                                  |
| Typed into the wrong window    | Focus the Roblox window before pressing Right Shift.                                 |
| Google API error               | Check your internet connection.                                                      |
| No loopback device detected    | **Windows:** Update audio drivers / enable Stereo Mix. **macOS:** Install BlackHole. |
| Typing too fast or too slow    | Change `SKILL_LEVEL`.                                                                |
